In Kinde, you can build a list of subscribers so you can communicate to them about your business, products, and services. For example, you might use the subscriber form for:

- lead generation
- newsletters
- campaigns
- product or feature communication

Once a contact is in your subscriber list, they can be easily converted to users later.

This list is different to your [Access request contacts](/build/set-up-options/manage-access-requests/), whoâ€™s details you collected when they registered interest in your product.

## Set up a subscription form

Kinde allows you to design the page where customers can go to subscribe to your newsletter or other product updates. See [Set up a subscription form](https://kinde.com/docs/customize/set-up-subscription-form/).

## View subscriber details

1. In Kinde, go to **Users > Subscribers**. A list of contacts is shown.
2. To see when a person subscribed, find them in the list, select the three dots menu and select **View details**. A panel slides out showing added information.

## Add a subscriber

1. Go to **Users > Subscribers** and select **Add subscriber**.
2. In the window that appears, enter their name and email address.
3. Select **Save**.

## Convert a subscriber to a user

1. Go to **Users > Subscribers** and find the contact you want to convert to a user.
2. Select the three dots menu and select **Convert to user**. A window appears, prompting you to select the organization the user will belong to. You can only select one.
3. Select **Convert**. The contact will now appear on the **All users** list, but will also remain a subscriber.

See [Manage users across organizations](/manage-users/about/manage-users-across-organizations/) if you want to assign the user to other organizations.

## Delete a subscriber

1. Go to **Users > Subscribers** and find the contact you want to delete.
2. Select the three dots menu and select **Delete subscriber**. A confirmation message appears.
3. Confirm you want to delete the subscriber and select **Delete subscriber**. The person is permanently removed from the subscriber list.
