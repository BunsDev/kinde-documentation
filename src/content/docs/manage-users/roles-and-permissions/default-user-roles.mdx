When users first sign up to your app or service, you can automatically assign them roles and permissions. This means users are able to interact with your application immediately - in the way you define - without waiting for additional access.

For example, you might assign everyone a role for basic permissions, and have other more advanced functions available on request.

There are two ways to to do this:

- Make any of your existing roles available to new sign ups - [Edit a pre-defined role](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-roles/) and switch on the **Assign to new users** option.
- Create a new role for this purpose - see below. Note that you need to have [permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/) set up already.

## Create and enable a default role for new sign ups

1. Go to **Settings** > **Roles**. The **User roles** page opens. If you already have roles set up, these are shown here.
2. Select **Add role**. The **Add role** window opens.
3. Give the role a **Name**. Keep it short and descriptive, so you can easily understand what it is for. For example, ‘Sign up basic access’.
4. Enter a **Description**. Describe what a user with this role can do. For example ‘Allows new users to perform all basic actions.’
5. Enter a **Key**. The key is how your code references the role in Kinde. Ideally, it’s a word that is easy to reference in code and match in your product. You should also follow a naming convention to help maintain your code. E.g. `sign_up_basic_access`.
6. Select the **Assign to new users** option.
7. Select the permissions that are included in the role by switching them on.
8. Select **Save**. All new users who sign up to your application will be assigned this role.
