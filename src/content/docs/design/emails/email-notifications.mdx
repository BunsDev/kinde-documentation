If emails are part of your authentication processes for users - for example, users receive sign-in codes via email in a passwordless process - you can customize email details, with some limitations.

## **Change the email sender** **name**

You can add your business or brand name so it appears as the sender of emails.

1. Go to **Settings > Email**.
2. Enter your business or brand name in the **Sender** name field.
3. Select **Save**.

## Change the email sender address

If you want to change the email sender address, you add your own email provider’s SMTP details. See [Customize email sender](/get-started/connect/customize-email-sender/).

## **Change email logo**

Emails inherit the logo you set as part of your [global brand](/design/pages/design-your-welcome-pages/). But you can also set a unique logo [for each organization](/design/brand/apply-branding-for-an-organization/) in your business.

## Change who verification emails are sent from

_Only applies if you choose not to send emails from your own provider_

When Kinde sends an email on your behalf, it is sent from the ‘Business name’ listed in your Kinde business by default.

For example:

<img
  src="https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/aad2b06f-1a1d-4da0-8643-ef3709cb9c00/public"
  alt=""
  width="672px"
  height="auto"
  fetchpriority="low"
  loading="lazy"
  decoding="async"
/>

If you want emails to come from your app name instead (if it is different), then you can edit the business name in **Settings > Business > Details**, without it affecting your Kinde domain or other environment settings.

## Change email content

It is not currently possible to change the content of emails.
