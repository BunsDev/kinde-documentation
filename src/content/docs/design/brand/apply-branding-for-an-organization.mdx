If your business model supports multi-tenancy or multiple user groups and you use [organizations](/build/organizations/multi-tenancy-using-organizations/) in Kinde, you can apply brand overrides to modify the pages in each organization.

This means that when a user signs up or signs in to an organization, they have the brand experience associated with that organization, through page logo and colours.

You can change the background, button, and text colours, as well as the favicon and logo for:

- Sign up and sign in pages
- Request access and subscription pages
- Emails
