By default, all Kinde user-facing screens (for example the sign up and sign in screens) are in US English. However, you can make your end-user authentication experience more international by selecting multiple languages for these screens as well.

## What screens can be translated?

Only the user facing authentication screens: Sign up, sign in, verification code, confirmations, etc. are translated. It is not yet possible to select a different language for the whole Kinde platform.

To change the language displayed on sign up and request access pages, you need to [customize the relevant page](/design/pages/design-your-welcome-pages/).

## Supported languages

Kindeâ€™s language support offering is growing all the time.

Hereâ€™s just a sample of what we have so far: English (en / en-US / en-AU / en-GB), Dutch, German, Polish, Hebrew, Italian, French, Malay, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese (Brazilian), Norwegian, Swedish.

We aim to eventually support [all these languages](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-translations#language-codes).

Feel free to submit a pull request via [GitHub](https://github.com/kinde-oss/kinde-translations) to request or contribute a specific language translation.

## Choose languages

Kinde will display the relevant language on authentication screens, when the userâ€™s regional settings are detected.

1. Go to **Settings > Languages**.
2. In the **Supported languages** section, select the checkboxes of all the languages you want to support.

## Change the default language

The default language is the fallback language if a userâ€™s region is not detected, or if the detected language is not selected as supported in Kinde.

1. Go to **Settings > Languages**.
2. In the **Default language** dropdown, choose the language you would like to display as standard.

## How Kinde displays languages

For user-facing authentication screens, Kinde gives display priority to languages as follows:

1. The language supplied in the auth url ^
2. The preferred language selected in the userâ€™s browser ^
3. The default language you have selected in Kinde
4. US English as a last resort, if a translation is not available

^ If you have chosen not to support a language, we will try the next available option.

Through language matching, Kinde automatically works out the closest base language to the requested language and will use this if supported by your app.

## Customize text on authentication pages

You can customize the text on the **Sign up, Sign in, Request access** and **Confirmation code** screens. See [Design your welcome pages](/design/pages/design-your-welcome-pages/) for more information.

## Support for right to left (RTL) languages

Yes, we are the only auth provider who supports this. ðŸ¤˜
