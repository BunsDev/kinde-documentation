To link to your applicationâ€™s homepage from your sign in page, you need to add a homepage URL to each of your applications. Once you do this:

- Your business logo on the sign-in page will link to your application homepage
- If a browser or other error occurs, we can provide a link to your user, to get them back to your application homepage

## Set the homepage URL for your applications

1. In Kinde, go to **Setting > Applications**.
2. Select **Configure** on the relevant application.
3. In the left menu, select **Authentication**.
4. Scroll to the **Callback URLs** section.
5. Add the **Application homepage URI**, e.g. `https://app.yourapp.com`
6. Select **Save**.
7. Repeat for each relevant application.
