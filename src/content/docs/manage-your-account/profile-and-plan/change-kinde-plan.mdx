Kinde customers on a free plan can upgrade to Pro at any time. Note that you need to be an Owner or Admin team member to upgrade.

There are a number of ways you can upgrade. These are described below.

## Follow the in-product upgrade prompts

When you are on a Free plan, you’ll see messages throughout the Kinde Admin area for upgrading to Pro. When you are ready, click any of the prompts and you will be guided through the sign-up process.

Note that you do not need to enter payment details immediately, you can add these later, as we charge in arrears and not in advance.

## Upgrade from the Plan & payments page

1. Go to **Settings > Plan & payments**.
2. Select **Upgrade** at the top of the page.
3. Follow the prompts.

## Downgrade from Pro to Free plan

It is possible to be downgraded from Pro to the Free plan, however, you cannot do this yourself in Kinde.

First, ensure you are not using any Pro features, or exceeding Free plan limits for MAU, etc. Then contact us at support@kinde.com to discuss downgrading.

## Change to a custom plan

We know some businesses are more complex than others. If you feel you have special requirements or would like to discuss how we can better support your business growth, contact us at support@kinde.com and we’ll make an appointment to chat.
