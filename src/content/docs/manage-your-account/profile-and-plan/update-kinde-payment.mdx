Kindeâ€™s approach to charging subscription fees is to deduct a payment for paid plans on the monthly anniversary of your sign up, calculated in arrears. So if you signed up on 1 December, your first bill will be issued on 1 January, for usage in December.

To keep payment details current, use this procedure to enter your credit card details in Kinde.

1. Go to **Settings > Plan & payments**.
2. Scroll to the **Payment details** section.
3. Select **Add card details**.
4. In the window that appears, add your credit card details and follow the prompts to save.
