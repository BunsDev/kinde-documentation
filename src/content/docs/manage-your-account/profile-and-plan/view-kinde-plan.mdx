Whether you pay us to use Kinde or not, your Kinde account is linked to a plan. A plan describes what features and limits apply to your Kinde account. There are two tiers: Free and Pro, as well as custom plans for enterprises.

## Plan options

Weâ€™ve made it so our free plans include a lot, so you can run your business for free if you want. But you will see prompts throughout the Kinde admin area, indicating which features can be extended, included, or made unlimited, by upgrading to Pro.

You can also view [full plan details and comparisons](https://kinde.com/pricing/) on our website.

## To view your plan

Go to **Settings > Plan & payments**. The page shows details and data related to your Kinde subscription.
