If you want, you can change the timezone that is used in your Kinde business account. The time zone that you select is reflected in areas that show dates, such as user history, audit logs, etc.

1. Go to **Settings > Business > Profile**.
2. In the **Time zone** field, make a selection.
3. At the bottom of the page, select **Save**.
