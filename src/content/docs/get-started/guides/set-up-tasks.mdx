The whole idea of Kinde is you can set it up the way you want, without too much fuss.

Here are common some set up tasks. Depending on your business structure and how you want to do things, you may do some or all.

## Business settings

- [Use your own domain](/build/domains/pointing-your-domain/) for sign up and sign in
- Add links to [privacy policy and terms of service](/manage-your-account/business-information/policies-terms/)
- [Invite team members](/get-started/team-and-account/add-team-members/) to help you set up
- [Create another environment](/build/environments/environments/), such as a local development environment

## Applications

- Set [callback and redirect URLs](/get-started/connect/callback-urls/) in your applications, and ensure they match the URLs in your code.
- Switch on [authentication options](/authenticate/manage-authentication/user-auth-applications/) for your applications.

## Appearance and user experience

- Set up the [request access](/design/pages/set-up-the-request-access-page/) page (if your app is not yet in the market)
- Add your [email provider details](/get-started/connect/customize-email-sender/) so emails come from you and not Kinde
- Set your global brand theme for [emails and pages](/design/pages/design-your-welcome-pages/), including sign up and sign in pages
- [Create a form](https://kinde.com/docs/customize/set-up-subscription-form/) to collect emails from mailing list subscribers

## Authentication

- Select and [set up authentication](https://kinde.com/docs/authentication-and-access/set-up-user-authentication/) for your apps
- Enable [social sign up options](/authenticate/social-sign-in/add-social-sign-in/)
- Set up [multi-factor authentication](https://kinde.com/docs/authentication-and-access/enable-multi-factor-authentication/)
- Add [Azure AD](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/azure/) or [SAML](https://kinde.com/docs/authentication-and-access/custom-saml/) enterprise authentication (if you have enterprise customers)

## Users

- [Import users](/manage-users/add-and-edit/import-users-in-bulk/) into Kinde, or [add them manually](/manage-users/add-and-edit/add-and-edit-users/)
- Add [user permissions](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-permissions/)
- Add and assign [user roles](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/user-roles/)

## Integrations

- [Register your APIs](/developer-tools/kinde-api/register-an-api/) on Kinde

- Add [Google Analytics](/manage-users/view-activity/track-user-sign-in-with-google-analytics/) to track user sign ups and sign ins

## Organizations (B2B/+ businesses)

- Add or [import organizations](/build/organizations/import-organizations/)
