If you’ve received a Kinde perk code from a Kinde Community Partner, you need to enter the code into your account to claim the credits. Here’s how.

1. Sign in to Kinde.
2. Go to **Settings > Business > Details.**
3. Scroll to the **Kinde perk code** field and enter the code. For example, `FreeCredits`.
4. Click **Save**.

The credits will be applied to your account. Expect this credit to be deducted from your normal billing until the credit runs out.
