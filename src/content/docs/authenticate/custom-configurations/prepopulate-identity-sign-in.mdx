You can create a smoother sign up and sign in experience for users by passing `login_hint` with the auth URL. This means when the user arrives at the sign in screen, their email is pre-filled, saving them time.

You might want to do this, for example, if you invite users to sign up via email and you want to reduce friction and make signing up extra easy.

## Email identity

To enable this for the email identity method, add the `login_hint` parameter to the sign up/sign in request on your app or site. Hereâ€™s an example of how you might add it in React.

```jsx
<button
  onClick={() =>
    login({
      authUrlParams: {
        login_hint: "dave@kinde.com"
      }
    })
  }
>
  Continue with email
</button>
```
