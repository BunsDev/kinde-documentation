All business, user, and organization data stored in Kinde is made up of ‘properties’. Properties are single data points or fields, like email, first name, last name, phone number, address, etc.

Kinde comes with a standard set of properties that make up business, user, and organization profiles, but you can also [add custom properties](/properties/work-with-properties/manage-properties/) to capture any data you like.

For example, you might want to record a billing address separate to a delivery address, or capture screen names, job titles, or other customer information.

Properties can also be used to create custom claims.

## Properties can be passed in tokens

You can choose to make a property ‘public’ so it can be made available to be passed via a token. This is essentially a way of creating a custom claim, enabling data to be transferred system to system, via API. For more information see [Add and manage properties in tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/).

## Kinde-included properties

To get you started, we’ve included a set of common properties. You can easily identify these as the code key starts with `kp-` meaning Kinde-provided. You cannot edit or delete these properties.

## C**ustom properties**

The needs of every business is different, that’s why you can create your own properties and use them any way you want. For example, you might want to create a property to collect marketing information or customer relationship data.

## Property categories

Properties can be organized using [property categories](/properties/work-with-properties/property-groups/). When you create a category, it becomes a heading in a user or organization record.

Categories ensure similar fields are grouped together for easier display. For example, you might have a group for ‘billing information’ and a separate group for ‘delivery information’, even though they contain similar properties.

| Category             | Properties                                         | For          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Billing information  | Billing contact, Billing address, Billing phone    | Organization |
| Delivery information | Delivery contact, Delivery address, Delivery phone | Organization |

And example of user categories might be:

| Category         | Properties         | For  |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---- |
| Accounts contact | Name, email, phone | User |
| Next of kin      | Name, email, phone | User |

## **How properties are displayed in Kinde**

The way you label and group properties impacts how the data is displayed in Kinde. Here’s an example of how properties are displayed:
