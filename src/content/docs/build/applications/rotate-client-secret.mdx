To ensure your applications remain secure, you can periodically rotate the Client secret stored in the Kinde-side application.

You can only do this for back-end and machine-to-machine applications.

Note that you can only rotate a client secret by completely deactivating the old one. So you must update any dependent apps, connections, and services with the new secret ASAP.

## Rotate client secret in Kinde

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications**.
2. Select **View details** on the relevant application.
3. Scroll to the **Admin actions** section and select **Rotate client secret**. A confirmation window opens.
4. If you want, opt in to rotate the client secret and retain the old secret. You may need to upgrade to do this.
5. If you don’t want to retain the previous secret, or you don’t want to upgrade, select **Rotate client secret**. A new client secret is generated.
6. Update any dependent apps, connections, and services with the new secret.
