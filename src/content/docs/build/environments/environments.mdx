Kinde allows you to run multiple environments to support your software development cycle. By default, Kinde comes with a production environment, but you can create other environments, such as staging, testing, beta, etc. to meet your team’s needs.

Caution: Make sure you use the first environment (the one you got when you first sign up to Kinde) as your production environment. This is important for when you are [ready to go live](/build/environments/production-to-live/).

You can see the environment at the top of every page when signed in.

## **Take care using multiple environments**

Unless you are a developer, we recommend you stay in the production environment for viewing and working with your Kinde account.

For developers who want to test new user configurations or make other changes, do this in a testing or staging environment first, before replicating in the production environment.

## Rate limiting for live production environments

Before you make your production environment live, [follow ](/build/environments/production-to-live/)[this checklist](/build/environments/production-to-live/).

The most important item being to ensure any [third-party authentication](https://kinde.com/docs/authentication-and-access/set-up-user-authentication/) connections (such as social connections or enterprise connections) are set up with the third-party’s Client ID and Client secret. If you leave these fields blank during setup, Kinde’s credentials will be used used as a proxy, and rate limits will apply.

Note that you can leave these fields blank in your non-production environments. Non-production environments cannot be made live.

## **View and manage environments**

Select **Switch environments** from the **Environment** menu at the top of the screen. The **Environments** page opens showing your current and other environments.

## **Add an environment**

On the **Environments** page, select **Add environment**. Enter a name and code for the environment, then select **Save**.

## **Switch between environments**

On the **Environments** page, switch to an environment by selecting **Switch to this environment**.

## **Edit environments**

On the **Environments** page, select the three dots (…) in the top right corner of the environment you want to edit. Make your changes and select **Save**.
