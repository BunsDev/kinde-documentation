If you use [organizations in Kinde](/build/organizations/multi-tenancy-using-organizations/), you probably build and maintain multi-tenant software. You might also manage multiple subdomains for those tenants.

To help ensure your organizations’ users are redirected to the right subdomain when they sign in, we’ve added what we call ‘organization handles’.

## How it works

You add a handle to an organization’s details. The handle exactly matches the top level subdomain name of that organization. For example, `clairesgym` is the handle for `https://clairesgym.jimsgiantgyms.com` .

Then when you go to set callback URLs for each subdomain, you just use one template URL that uses the `{organization_handle}` to construct a URL that works for all your orgs.

- This feature works for top level subdomains only
- Handles must exactly match subdomain names
- Handles must be unique for each organization

Currently, handles can only be added manually through the Kinde admin portal, but we plan to add this as an API function soon.

## Add the subdomain template URL to your application in Kinde

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications > [your application] > Details.**
2. Scroll to the **Callback URLs** section and in the **Allowed callback URLs** field, add `https://{organization.handle}.<mysite>.com.au`, and replace `<mysite>` with your web domain. For example, `https://{organization.handle}.jimsgiantgyms.com`
3. Select **Save**.
4. Repeat from step 1 for each app you want to enable this for.

## Add handles to your organizations

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations > [your organization] > Details.**
2. Enter the subdomain name for this organization to the **Handle** field, without the added URL information. For example, enter `clairesgym` for the subdomain `https://clairesgym.jimsgiantgyms.com`. Ensure the subdomain name and the handle match exactly. The handle must also be unique within your Kinde business.
3. Select **Save**.
