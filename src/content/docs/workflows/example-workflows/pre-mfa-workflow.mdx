<Aside type="upgrade">

This workflow trigger is only available on the Kinde Scale plan

</Aside>

Trigger: `user:pre_mfa`

This trigger is fired after the user has complete single factor authentication (e.g email + password or Google) and determined which organization (if any) they are trying to access. 

## Example use cases

### Determining if MFA is required based on data in an external service

You may be using a service like Zanzibar or OpenFGA for fine-grained access control and wish to call out to it to determine if a user needs to complete MFA.

### Making MFA required if a user has a certain permission

You may wish to enforce MFA for users who have some sensitive permissions such as `delete:project` .

### Skipping MFA for certain organizations

You want to enforce MFA at an environment level for all organizations, but there are a few who do not want to adopt your policy.

### MFA prompts

When you only want to prompt MFA when a user has not been prompted for MFA over a certain time period.

## Workflow code

### The event object

The main argument provided to your code is the Kinde workflow `event` object which has two keys `request` and `context`. This gives you access to the reason the workflow was triggered and additional relevant datapoints. Hereâ€™s an example:

```jsx
{
  "request": {
  },
  "context": {
    "auth": {
			"connectionId": "conn_01945d3ccf4926118bfdeb6e1158edb5" // connection ID the user auth'd with
		},
	  "domains": {
	    "kindeDomain": "https://example.kinde.com"
	  },
    "mfa": {
      "policy": "required", // required | optional | off
      "context": "environment", // environment or organization
      "enabledFactors": ["mfa:sms", "mfa:email", "mfa:authenticator_app"], // factors you have enabled for this context
      "isUserRoleExempt": false, // advanced orgs can make specific roles exempt from MFA
      "isUserConnectionExempt": false // advanced orgs can make enterprise connections exempt from MFA
    }
    "user": { 
	    "id": "kp_77d28fc7b16240dd9ec12b08071fe46e" // the users ID
	  },
    "workflow": {
	    "trigger": "user:pre_mfa"
	  },
    "application": {
	    "clientId": "cee9743fc7ee4d2e84061fe1a662051d"
	   },
    "organization": {
	    "code": "org_75ad9f26d2c"
	   }
  }
}
```

### Workflow settings

```jsx
export const workflowSettings = {
  id: "preMFA",
  name: "Pre-MFA",
  failurePolicy: {
    action: "stop",
  },
  trigger: "user:pre_mfa",
  bindings: {
    "kinde.mfa": {}, // required to change the MFA policy
  },
};
```

### MFA binding

The `kinde.mfa` binding is used to modify the MFA policy for the current auth flow.

```jsx
// In the current flow the user will be asked to complete MFA
kinde.mfa.setEnforcementPolicy("required");

// In the current flow the user will be exempt from MFA
kinde.mfa.setEnforcementPolicy("skip");
```

### External system query example

This example demonstrates using the [environment variables](/build/env-variables/add-manage-env-variables/) feature to store a secret API_KEY to call a FGA system, to determine if a user needs to do MFA.

```tsx
import {
  onPreMFAEvent,
  getKindeAccessTokenHandle,
  WorkflowSettings,
  WorkflowTrigger,
  createKindeAPI
} from "@kinde/infrastructure";

export const workflowSettings: WorkflowSettings = {
  id: "preMFA",
  name: "Pre MFA",
  failurePolicy: {
    action: "stop",
  },
  trigger: WorkflowTrigger.PreMFA,
  bindings: {
    "kinde.fetch": {}, // Required for external API calls
    "kinde.env": {}, // required to access your environment variables
    url: {}, // required for url params
  },
};

export default async function handlePreMFA(event: onPreMFAEvent) {

	const FGA_API_KEY = getEnvironmentVariable('MY_FGA_API_KEY')?.value
	const {user, organization} = event.context;
  const { data: fgaData } = await fetch(`https://someFGAsystem.io/?api_key=${FGA_API_KEY}`, {
    method: "POST",
    responseFormat: 'json',
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
	    userId: user.id,
	    orgCode: organization.code
    })
  });
  
  const isMfaRequired = fgaData.some(permission => permission === 'delete:sensitive');
	const policy = isMfaRequired ? 'required' : 'skip';
  kinde.mfa.setEnforcementPolicy(policy);
   
};
  
```
